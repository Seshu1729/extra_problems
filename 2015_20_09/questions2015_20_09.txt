1.Given a unsigned number as a string input(it can be of length, max 10000 chars) write a function
to find whether the number is divisible by 11 or not
2.An unsigned number Q is formed by taking input P which is an unsigned integer in string format,
K:number of times P repeated to form Q.write a function to find whether the number Q is divisible by 11 or not
    Ex:Q:123123123  P:123 K:3
3.Same string as Q2,write a function for divisible by 3
4.Given two string which are unsigned integer numbers(in string format)write an adder to add the numbers.Lengths 
of both can be different
